# Introduction #

Cosmographia is based on the Qt application framework. This is currently the only external dependency; all other required libraries are in the SVN tree.

Follow these steps to get started:
  * Checkout the cosmographia source code (follow the instructions at http://code.google.com/p/cosmographia/source/checkout )
  * Download and install the free LGPL version of the Qt SDK from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads
  * Launch the Qt Creator development environment and open the project file cosmographia.pro
  * Choose 'Open Build/Run Target Selector' from Qt Creators Build menu; change the build from 'Debug' to Release.
  * Choose 'Build' from the Build menu (Ctrl-B, or Command-B on the Mac)
  * Choose 'Run' from the Build menu (Ctrl-R, or Command-R on the Mac)

**Cosmographia requires Qt version 4.7.1 or later!** The user interface of Cosmographia is written (partly) in the QML language, which is a recent addition to the Qt framework.
