Cosmographia is an application for visualization of space missions and Solar System exploration. It uses spacecraft trajectories and planet ephemerides from SPICE kernels to precisely reproduce the geometry of encounters.

Please note that this project is in a very early and rough stage of development, and Cosmographia is a working name only. Some features already available in this early version include:

  * Automatic, multithread downloading of high resolution textures
  * Loading and updating of catalog files at run time
  * Shadows and reflections on models
  * Realistic stars
  * Realistic atmospheres
  * Automatic update of satellite two-line elements
